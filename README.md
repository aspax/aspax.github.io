## What's this?
The source of [aspax.github.io](http://aspax.github.io), the "official" website of [aspax](http://github.com/icflorescu/aspax) - the simple Node.js asset packager.

## Built with ASPAX and Jekyll
The assets on this website are, of course, compiled, concatenated and compressed with ASPAX.

The website is built with Jekyll and deployed/hosted as a GitHub organization page.
